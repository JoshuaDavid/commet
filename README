This software is a computer program whose purpose is to find all the
similar reads between two set of NGS reads. It also provide a similarity
score between the two samples.

INSTALLATION

Commet's programs have been written in C++. To compile the programs, a makefile 
using your g++ compiler is provided:

make

If you want to install in /usr/local/bin, run with root permissions (use sudo):

make
make install
or
sudo make install

Then, you can test the executables in directory ABC_bench where you'll find 
the run_ABC.sh script.

USER GUIDE

A user guide is provided in the directory named doc. Each tool is described
more than in this README file.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This package contains four applications :

filter_reads
compare_reads
extract_reads
bvop

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
FILTER_READS

  - input: 
    - One file containing reads (nucleotide sequences) in fasta or fastq format. 
      The input file may be compressed with gzip algorithm.
    - Three parameters for read selection : - minimum size          [default=0]
                                            - maximum number of N   [default=MAX_INT]
                                            - minimum Shannon index [default=0]

  - output: 
    - One file containing a vector of bits. 
      To each bit of the vector corresponds a read in the input file. 
      If the bit is 1, then the read was not removed by the filter, if 0, the read was removed.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
EXTRACT_READS

  - input:
    - One file containing reads (nucleotide sequences) in fasta or fastq format.
      The input file may be compressed with gzip algorithm.
    - One file containing a vector of bits of the same size.

  - output:
    - One file containing the reads that correspond to a 1 in the vector of bits


———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
COMPARE_READS

  - input:
    - Two files (A and B) containing reads (nucleotide sequences) in fasta or fastq format. 
      The input files may be compressed with gzip algorithm.
    - Options : for each file, a boolean vector that represents the filtered reads

  - output:
    - Two files containing the vectors of bits corresponding to:
      - reads from A found in B 
      - reads from B found in A

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
BVOP

  - input:
    - One file containing a vector of bits.
    - Options : another file containing a vector of bits depending on the operation.

  - output:
    - One file containing a vector of bits.
